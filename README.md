## Participation guideline: <a name="participate"></a>

Please note that we strive to maintain a positive and supportive harassment-free  environment for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or work experience.
We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. Therefore, we would like to ask  that you follow our code of conduct in all interactions both on and offline.

## Background: <a name="background"></a>

OpenCider (Open Computational Inclusion and Digital Equity Resource) offers a space for sharing knowledge, advice, good practices, workflows and tools to facilitate computational training and big data analysis. We focus on supporting diverse communities of researchers from varied backgrounds by providing fair access to knowledge to encourage global participation and enhance digital equity by promoting open data practices. 

### Vision:

Our vision is to create a valuable resource for effective knowledge transfer and building inclusive communities to advance participation in open research and innovation.

### The Problem:
To advance active participation in open data practices and to improve the quality of research, we need to encourage the participation of under represented groups. In other words, we need to enhance diversity in open data and open research discussions in order to drive innovation and discovery. 

### Solution:
In order to create a more diverse open data community, there is a need to update current practices to promote fair and effective knowledge transfer by propagating more inclusive computational training as well as encouraging the development of tools and portable solutions adapted to resources of a wide variety of audience. This will help create a more diverse community, increasing participation, inclusion and visibility of under-represented groups such as those from LMICs (low and middle income countries).  

Enriching the open data community through propagating the foundations of equity, inclusion, sharing and fairness on a global scale, will provide significant benefits for research. This will translate to more effective use of resources, increased rigour, transparency, re-use, participation, accountability and reproducibility.

This resource is intended for anyone who is interested in open data, community building, inclusion and diversity as well as effective knowledge transfer and computational training practices.

I am the Research Data Management Team Leader supproting the Scientific Infrastructures unit at the Max DelbruÃàck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC). Before joining the MDC, I was a scientific database curator at the European Molecular Biology Laboratories (EMBL)-EBI and EMBO. During my time there, I gained comprehensive knowledge in data analysis, metadata extraction and description, data repositories, journal publishing requirements, open science data sharing practices and FAIR data principles. Prior to that, I gained my PhD from the University of Bern,Switzerland where I studied the role of amino acid transporters in colon cancer progression. 
 
I am a strong advocate for community building and the promotion of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.
