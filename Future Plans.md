# Future plans 
* Creating a website providing the current information in a readily available, coherent intelligible format.

* Launching a survey to assess the academic landscape with regards to;

    - Which tools are used by researchers at different data life-cycle i.e. Planning, Creation/Collection of data, Analysis, Sharing, Preservation.

    - Which tools are used by researchers in aid of improving computational inclusion such as those used in capacity building/training and community building.

    - What technological challenges/ shortcomings contribute to reduced computational inclusion.

  - Analysing data from survey results and looking at trends in computational infrastructure and resources in different geographical regions to identify areas with reduced computational inclusion such as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

* Helping institutes assess their digital landscape to enhance computational inclusion in academic research.

* Providing a community forum for researchers interested in openness and digital inclusion to interact and contribute.

* Providing know-how guides and/or linking to communities specialized for training events.
